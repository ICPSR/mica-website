MICA, or “Measuring and Improving the Efficacy of Curation Activities in Data Archives” is a three-year National Digital Infrastructures and Initiatives project led by investigators at the University of Michigan School of Information in partnership with the Inter- university Consortium for Political and Social Research. This project studies how curatorial actions impact the use of digital collections. This project will assess stakeholder needs, priorities, and values for data reuse and create curatorial metrics for measuring the impact of curation activities.

**Goals**

1. Understand how to responsibly allocate resources to data archiving
2. Articulate data archiving policies that efficiently and effectively achieve funders’ and journals’ innovation and transparency goals
