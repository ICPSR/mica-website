## Measuring the Impact of Curatorial Actions

**What is the value of sharing research data? How does curation impact data discovery and reuse?**

MICA, or “Measuring and Improving the Efficacy of Curation Activities in Data Archives” is a three-year National Digital Infrastructures and Initiatives project led by investigators at the [University of Michigan School of Information](https://www.si.umich.edu/) in partnership with the [Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/). This project studies how curatorial actions impact the use of digital collections by: 1) identifying curatorial actions; 2) measuring the impacts of curation; and 3) developing curatorial metrics.



**Goals**

1. Understand how to responsibly allocate resources to data archiving
2. Articulate data archiving policies that efficiently and effectively achieve funders’ and journals’ innovation and transparency goals
